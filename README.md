# Introduction

I wanted to express my sincere gratitude for the opportunity to undertake the machine test you provided. I'm pleased to inform you that I have successfully completed the assignment, which involved converting the mockup into responsive web pages using React JS, implementing routing and various functionalities as specified.

Live demo hosted on firebase - [Link](https://ads-canvas.web.app).

## Project Details

**Stack** - Html5, Css3, Scss, Javascript, ReactJs \
**Font** - Poppins \
**npm packages** - sass, react-redux, react-chartjs-2, chart.js, react-router-dom \
**Hosting** - Firebase

## Functionalities and tasks

**1. Create top navigation - Dashboard & Create Ad** ✅ \
I have successfully implemented the top navigation, which is responsive on all devices. For mobile view, I added a hamburger menu that, when clicked, opens the navigation links in full screen.

**2. Add sorting option to tables (High to Low & Low to High)** ✅ \
Sorting functionality has been added for all categories. Hovering or clicking on a category in the table header triggers a dropdown menu, allowing users to choose to sort from high to low or low to high.

**3. Create a toggle for Ads Insights showing a doughnut chart & table** ✅ \
I have developed a toggle button that displays either the chart or the table with the relevant data.

**4. Create a dropdown for matrixes in Ads Insights. Selecting a matric will show data in the doughnut chart for that matric.** ✅ \
I've introduced a dropdown with different options, such as clicks, conversions, revenue, and cost. Selecting any of these options updates the Doughnut chart to display the corresponding data.

**5. Based on the checkboxes (Text Ad and/or Media Ad), redirect to the Fill Data page and show respective inputs.** ✅ \
On the Create Ad page, when a user selects an option and clicks "Next," the relevant form is displayed. To achieve this, I used params to extract the URL and determine which form to display.

**6. After submitting the form, redirect to Ads Submitted, wait for 0.6 seconds, and redirect to Create Ads Page** ✅ \
Upon submitting the form, a modal opens to confirm the successful submission. After a brief delay of 0.6 seconds, users are redirected to the Create Ads page.

**Responsive** ✅ \
The application is fully responsive and functions seamlessly across various device widths.
